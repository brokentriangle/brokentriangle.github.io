We are a small development team, and we decided to code our website using the ASP.NET framework. We are currently hosing this project using Amazon Web Services and their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). We have decided to make the code available for anyone who is interested. If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to contact us at brokentriangleca@gmail.com.   

Thanks!
